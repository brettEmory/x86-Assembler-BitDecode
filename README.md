# Bitwise Operations and Key Creation

## Project Overview

This project involves implementing various bitwise operations and creating a key using assembly language. The project includes C and assembly files that perform specific tasks related to bit manipulation.

## Features

- **Bit Decoding:** Decodes bits using specified logic in C.
- **Rotate Right:** Rotates bits to the right using assembly.
- **Rotate Left:** Rotates bits to the left using assembly.
- **Key Creation:** Creates a key using specific bitwise operations in assembly.

## File Structure

- **bit_decode.c:** C program that decodes bits.
- **rotate_right.s:** Assembly program to rotate bits to the right.
- **rotate_left.s:** Assembly program to rotate bits to the left.
- **create_key.s:** Assembly program to create a key using bitwise operations.
- **Makefile:** The makefile to compile the programs.
- **lab6Readme:** The readme file provided with detailed instructions and requirements.

## Setup and Installation
